**Analysis of the worldwide pandemic COVID-19**

 1. The dataset has been loaded from various sources.
 
 2. Data Analysis of the spread of the virus is from 22nd January, 2020 to 7th April, 2020.
 
 3. For data visualisation I have used the plotly library of python.
 
 Analysis is done over the rate at which cases have risen all over the world with the help of Bar graphs, Line graphs, animations, chloropleth maps etc.
 
 Country wise graphs as well as cosmopolitan graphs have been used for better analysis.
 
 Detailed analysis has been done over the confirmed cases over time, deaths as well as recoveries.
 
 I have also tried to visualise the relation between Mean-age of different countries and the death-by-confirmed cases ratio respectively.
